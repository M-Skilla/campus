- No unified search capability across different information sources
- Mobile-unfriendly interfaces limiting access on smartphones and tablets
- Time-sensitive information often missed due to poor notification systems
- Archived information difficult to locate and reference

2.3 Feedback and Suggestion Limitations

Traditional suggestion and feedback mechanisms present obstacles:

- Limited channels for student-administration communication
- Slow response times to student queries and suggestions
- Lack of transparency in suggestion processing and resolution
- No systematic tracking of suggestion status and outcomes
- Informal feedback channels leading to lost or unaddressed concerns

2.4 User Management Complexity

Educational institutions struggle with user management across platforms:

- Multiple authentication systems creating password fatigue
